# 1. Add a function named `list_benefits()` that returns the following list of strings:
#    "More organized code",
#    "More readable code",
#    "Easier code reuse",
#    "Allowing programmers to share and connect code together"
# Modify this function to return a list of strings as defined above
# def list_benefits():
#     pass

# 1. Add a function named `build_sentence(info)`
#    which receives a single argument containing a string
#    and returns a sentence starting with the given string
#    and ending with the string " is a benefit of functions!"
# Modify this function to concatenate to each benefit - " is a benefit of functions!"
# def build_sentence(benefit):
#     pass

# 1. Run and see all the functions work together!

# def name_the_benefits_of_functions():
#     list_of_benefits = list_benefits()
#     for benefit in list_of_benefits:
#         print(build_sentence(benefit))
