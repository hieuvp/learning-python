# With a single quote
MY_STRING = 'hello'
print(MY_STRING)

# Or a double quotes
MY_STRING = "hello"
print(MY_STRING)

# The difference between the two is that
# using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes
# (whereas these would terminate the string if using single quotes)
MY_STRING = "Don't worry about apostrophes"
print(MY_STRING)
