import numpy as np

weight_kg = [81.65, 97.52, 95.25, 92.98, 86.18, 88.45]

# First, convert the list of weights from a list to a Numpy array
# Create a numpy array np_weight_kg from weight_kg
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_kg)
print("np_weight_kg = %s" % np_weight_kg)

# Then, convert all of the weights from kilograms to pounds.
# Use the scalar conversion of 2.2 lbs per kilogram to make your conversion.
# Create np_weight_lbs from np_weight_kg
# np_weight_lbs

# Lastly, print the resulting array of weights in pounds.
# Print out np_weight_lbs
