Create a placeholder for future code:

```python
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
```

## Definition and Usage

The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code.

When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens,
but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed.

Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.

## More Examples

Using the pass keyword in a function definition:

```python
def myfunction:
  pass
```

Using the pass keyword in a class definition:

```python
class Person:
  pass
```

Using the pass keyword in an if statement:

```python
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass
```
